Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.  

This repository is using the following technologies:

- ASP.Net Web API 2
- Entity Framework 6 Code First
- TypeScript
- AngularJS 1.x
- SQL Server 2008 R2

The focus of this repository is being the API which multiple front ends can plug into.
