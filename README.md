# Proverb [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/johnnyreilly/proverb-gulp?retina=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohnReilly/proverb-gulp)

Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.  

This repository is using the following technologies:

- ASP.Net Web API and MVC
- Entity Framework 6 Code First
- TypeScript
- AngularJS
- SQL Server

The focus of this repository is swapping out Web Optimization and using GulpJS to generate minified assets.
