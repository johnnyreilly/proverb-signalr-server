# Proverb API

[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/johnnyreilly/proverb-signalr-server?retina=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohnReilly/proverb-signalr-server)

Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.  

This repository is using the following technologies:

- SignalR
- Entity Framework 6 Code First
- TypeScript
- AngularJS 1.x
- SQL Server

The focus of this repository is being the API which multiple front ends can plug into.
